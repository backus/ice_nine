* Move some of spec/unit/ice_nine/class_methods/deep_freeze_spec.rb into an
  integration test.
  * Keep some minimal unit tests just for the functionality in the method.
* Add a guard clause to IceNine.deep_freeze to prevent it from freezing an
  object that has already been frozen. This prevents infinite recursion
  errors when trying to freeze cyclical data structures.

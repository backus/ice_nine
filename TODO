* Move some of spec/unit/ice_nine/class_methods/deep_freeze_spec.rb into an
  integration test.
  * Keep some minimal unit tests just for the functionality in the method.
* Change all usage of #freeze from IceNine::Freezer subclasses to use
  IceNine.deep_freeze.
  * Add a guard clause to IceNine.deep_freeze to prevent it from freezing an
    object that has already been frozen. This prevents infinite recursion
    errors when trying to freeze cyclical data structures.

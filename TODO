* Add a guard clause to IceNine.deep_freeze to return the object immediately if
  it is already frozen.
  * If something is already frozen we want to trust that it's already been
    visited by IceNine, or some user provided code. We do not want to attempt to
    re-freeze the same objects over and over.
* Add a cache in IceNine::Freezer[] to avoid looking up the Freezer class more
  than once per type.
